## Why It Matters

Ray is a powerful distributed computing framework, but debugging and job monitoring can be complex and unintuitive.  
**RayHelper** bridges that gap by offering both CLI and GUI interfaces for quickly inspecting task trees, diagnosing failed jobs, and understanding runtime behavior.

Ideal for:
- Data scientists and ML engineers needing quick diagnostics into their applications tasks
- DevOps engineers managing distributed pipelines
- Teams debugging workloads in production
